# Student Performance Prediction Project

This project analyzes student performance data to predict academic success and provide insights for educational improvement.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Student Performance Dataset, which includes:
- Student grades in Mathematics
- Demographic information
- Social and study-related features
- Attendance records

## Project Structure
- `student_performance_analysis.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
